# Tester 

Write specs in ./spec/tester_spec.rb

Run with rspec in the root directory

## Concepts Covered

1. Test Driven Development and checking for state within objects to confirm correct initialization

2. Predicate matchers both built ('be_true') and custom made

3. Using helper methods like 'have' to compare the size of owned and unowned collections

4. Employing methods stubs, expectations, and test doubles in tandem
